% Verifying Signed Packages

* Verifying packages not quite as straight-forward.

  * Requires gpg installed on target host, bootstrap bloat.

  * Can be flaky calling external programs (c.f. khorben's
    recent patches)

* security/libnetpgpverify by agc@ provides relief:

  * Required a few fixes for subkeys (thanks Alastair)

  * Link static library into pkg_install and verify inline.

  * Small patch, in use since 2014Q4, but currently replaces
    support for GPG verification.  Anyone want to keep it?

* Our public key included in bootstrap kits, kits signed by
  the same key, and available via https://pkgsrc.joyent.com/
  so now end-to-end encryption for packages.
