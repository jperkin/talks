% Performance results

* In total has significantly reduced bulk build time:

    October 2012: ~10,634~ builds in ~48 hours~.
    October 2014: ~14,162~ builds in ~4.5 hours~.

* Can we improve any further, under 4 hours possible?

  * More hosts (easy but costs more, diminishing return)

  * make(1) caching would be a massive win

  * Continue tweaking MAKE_JOBS.  Package build times are
    logged, could do with dependency analysis to start heavy
    dependents as early as possible.

  * Stop building libnbcompat so many times.

  * Replace /bin/sh (ksh93) in build chroots.

* DTrace massively helpful in analysis.
