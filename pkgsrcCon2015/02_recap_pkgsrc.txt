% A Quick Recap - Package Sets

* 4 sets for each branch: tools, i386, x86_64, multiarch.

* Tools ~PREFIX=/opt/tools~, built from previous x86_64
  branch release.  Provides pbulk, bootstrap GCC, etc.

* The rest ~PREFIX=/opt/local~, using ~/opt/tools~ for
  bootstrap utilities.

* Multiarch combines 32-bit + 64-bit libraries into one
  package.

* Up until ~pkgsrc-2014Q3~ built on an older branch of SmartOS
  and will run on basically any release.

* ~pkgsrc-2014Q4~ onwards require running our ~20141030~ release
  or newer.

* ~pkgsrc-2014Q3~ / ~14.3.x~ slowly being deprecated.
