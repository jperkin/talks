% Miscellaneous Work

* Link all binaries against ~libumem~.

  * Legacy wrappers have ~_WRAP_EXTRA_ARGS.CC~ etc.

  * I added ~CWRAPPERS_LDADD~, need to convince joerg.

* Various changes to our ~lang/gcc47~

  * Support our multiarch ~ABI~ environment variable.

  * Forcibly disable ~-fomit-frame-pointer~, no more useless
    core dumps!

* Optimised ~REQUIRES~ on SmartOS, now only records direct
  dependencies (~DT_NEEDED~) rather than full ldd(1) output.

* Additional ~CHECK_WRKREF~ checks, enforce correctness.
