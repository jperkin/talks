% pkgbuild features

* Per-build ~pkgbuild.conf~, everything in scripts is
  abstracted and generic.

* Sandbox scripts for SmartOS/OSX/Linux, allows us to do
  useful things like override system headers:

    ~sys/epoll.h~ == ~#error "Do not use"~

* ~pkgdev~ zone image includes everything users need to start
  building/developing packages quickly:

  ~zone$~ run-sandbox 2015Q2-i386
  ~chroot$~ cd /shared/pkgsrc/mail/postfix
  ~chroot$~ echo "PKG_OPTIONS.postfix+= pgsql" >>/opt/local/etc/mk.conf
  ~chroot$~ bmake package
  ~chroot$~ exit
  ~zone$~ ls /shared/packages/SmartOS/2015Q2/i386/All/postfix-2.11.5nb1.tgz
