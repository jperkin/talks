% SmartOS Integration

* Main integration was with SMF, which we finally committed
  to pkgsrc.  Work ongoing to add manifests to packages.

* Added support for logadm, simple install/deinstall scripts:

    case ${STAGE} in
    POST-INSTALL)
        logadm -C 5 -c -s 100m -z 1 -w '@VARBASE@/log/mysql/*.log'
        ;;
    DEINSTALL)
        logadm -r '@VARBASE@/log/mysql/*.log'
        ;;
    esac

  * Need a good abstraction in pkgsrc to make this first-class.

* Added project support (resource controls) into ~mk/smf.mk~,
  configured via ~SMF_PROJECT_~ per-package variables.
