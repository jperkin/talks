% Verifying pkg-vulnerabilities

* Now that we can verify packages, adding support for also
  verifying pkg-vulnerabilities is easy.

* Only small issue is that the pkgsrc-security@pkgsrc.org
  key occasionally changes, and we don't want users to have
  to go looking for the new one manually.

* ~joyent/pkgsrc-gnupg-keys~ package contains the current key,
  each time the key is updated we'll add it to the keyring,
  bump the package version, users only need ~'pkgin upgrade'~.

* Just needs adding to pkg_install.conf
