% pkgbuild

* Lots of our build infrastructure was private for a time,
  made it impossible for users to reproduce our packages.

* This year finally worked on a way to export the public
  bits out into a repository:

    ~https://github.com/joyent/pkgbuild/~

* Includes everything needed to build:

  * Bootstrap scripts.

  * Per-branch configuration files.

  * Jenkins configuration (config.xml).

  * meta overlay (~INSTALL_TEMPLATES~, SMF manifests, etc).

* Now includes Linux and OSX build infrastructure too.
