% Long Term Support

* As we have so many zones in production, users tend to stick
  with what's running and leave it.

* Quite a few users still on very old package sets (2011Q4!),
  and then OpenSSL comes along...

* Backporting to every branch is untenable, come up with a
  plan for LTS:

  * Every year Q4 release will be marked LTS and supported
    for 3 years.

  * Continue to provide quarterly releases, but their support
    will end with pkgsrc-releng.

  * Critical fixes via ~joyent/feature/backports/<branch>~.

* Still in infancy, haven't done as many backports as we'd
  like.  Branch changes can make it tricky (~PHP_BASE_VERS~).
