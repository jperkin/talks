% Miscellaneous Other Improvements #2

* Avoid /bin/print in libtool (libtool used rather a lot).

* Improve single threaded parts of bulk build:

  * Add ~--make-jobs~ to bootstrap, saves a few minutes.

  * Generate package checksums at package time (thus making
    it a parallel operation), collating files at the end of
    the build for SHA512.bz2

  * Do the same for pkg_summary.gz, generating ~pkg_info -X~
    at package time.

* Reduces bulk build runtime by ~20 minutes~.

* Remove mk.conf from SCAN_DEPENDS for ~reuse_scan_results~

* Use ramdisks on OSX.
