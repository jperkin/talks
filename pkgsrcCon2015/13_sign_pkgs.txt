% Signed Packages

* Many users expect this and HTTPS by default in 2015.

* Signing packages is straight-forward thanks to the work by
  others previously.

  * Make sure gpg binary is available.  Create key.

  * Add SIGN_PACKAGES=gpg to mk.conf.

  * Configure ~GPG~ and ~GPG_SIGN_AS~ in pkg_install.conf.

* Build chroots have gpg-agent socket mounted, fully
  automated (we build a lot, manual process unacceptable).

* OS X currently manual, no way that I've found to mount
  agent socket in chroots (also impacts name resolution).
