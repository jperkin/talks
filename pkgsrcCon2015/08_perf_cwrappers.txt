% cwrappers

* Some platforms have more expensive fork() than others,
  legacy wrappers do a ~_lot_~ of forking.

* joerg@ wrote cwrappers but never integrated it, I helped
  finish the last few bits and bring it into the tree.

* Most packages saw ~1.5x~ - ~2x~ speedup, some ~3x+~

* Significant reduction in system time allows more chroots
  and MAKE_JOBS.  Have been using it since pkgsrc-2014Q4:

    August 2014:     ~14,017 packages in 12 hours~
    September 2014:  ~14,011 packages in 5.5 hours~

* Add USE_CWRAPPERS=yes to mk.conf and send us bug reports,
  let's make it the default.

* TODO: Integrate OSX fixes.
