% A Quick Recap - GitHub

* Development happens in our ~joyent/pkgsrc~ fork on GitHub.

  * Aim is to upstream as much as possible.

  * Anything which isn't ready goes into one of 3 feature
    branches:

      ~joyent/feature/miscfix/<branch>~     # General changes
      ~joyent/feature/multiarch/<branch>~   # Multiarch work
      ~joyent/feature/pbulkmulti/<branch>~  # MySQL/Percona

   * All get merged into ~joyent/release/<branch>~, pushes to
     release branches trigger Jenkins pbulk builds and new
     packages on ~pkgsrc.joyent.com~

* We add 200+ packages from ~pkgsrc-wip~ and ~pkgsrc-joyent~.

 * We accept pull requests (~110~ handled, ~15~ open) and issues
   (~132~ handled, ~50~ open) for people who prefer that route.
