% Tweak MAKE_JOBS

* Multiple chroots helped a lot, but now slowed down by
  individual packages taking ages (in an 18 hour build,
  7.5 hours taken up by failing lang/mercury build).

* Configure ~MAKE_JOBS~ based on ~PKGPATH~:

    ~MAKE_JOBS=2~  (default)
    ~MAKE_JOBS=4~  (268 packages, general speedup)
    ~MAKE_JOBS=6~  (just webkit*)
    ~MAKE_JOBS=8~  (21 highly dependent packages, e.g. gcc)

* With a lot of trial and error achieve a decent return:

    June 2013:    ~11,372 packages in 18 hours~
    August 2014:  ~14,017 packages in 12 hours~
